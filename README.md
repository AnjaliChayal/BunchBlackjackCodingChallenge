# Blackjack Developer Coding Assignment

## Objective

Take 4 hours and create a game of Blackjack!

### Requirements Description

* Create a fully functional game of Blackjack from scratch using only standard classes and common frameworks.

**Rules should follow:**

* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack.
* Dealer stands on 17
* Deck is made of up 8 standard decks of cards
* Ignore the hand splitting 

**Expected Features**

* Single-player game (dealer and one player at minimum)
* Basic Blackjack rules as described here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack#Rules
* The player should have cash and be able to bet according to the rules here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack#Rules_of_play_at_casinos (You can simplify these, as long as the basic bet/reward structure is in place)
* The ability to play multiple rounds with a persistent cash pool
* The ability to save game state and restore it after restarting
* Customizable game settings (Some examples of things to make adjustable: min bet amount, player starting cash amount, etc.)
* You can use this image for cards: http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs124/javanotes6/c13/cards.png

**Nice-to-Haves**

* Hand-splitting
* Between 2-6 user controlled players at the table where players can enter/leave the table at any time (all controlled locally)
* Single-player mode where other players at table are AI
* Game stats tracking (highest cash amount, etc.)
* Animations!

**Evaluation Criteria (in order of importance)**

1. The code does what it says it does.
2. **Well-designed architecture.** Assume this the first phase in a project with a much larger scope, and design accordingly. It's better to have well thought-out architecture with fewer features than to have tons of bells and whistles that are hacked together.
3. **Clean code that follows best practices.** We won't reject you because of a single missing access modifier, but you should be fairly dilligent. And don't worry about minor permutations of code style, you can learn our styles once you're onboard.
4. **Demonstrates some creativity and uniqueness.** Whatever that means to you - show us what you love to do!

**Deliverables**

1. Git repository with history intact. Commit early and often so that we can trace the appâ€™s development history. The more you show the better.
2. Include a README explaining the features you've implemented, and an outline of code architecture.
