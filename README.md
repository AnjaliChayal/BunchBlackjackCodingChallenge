**Deliverables**

1. Git repository with history intact.
Commit early and often so that we can trace the appâ€™s development history. The more you show the better.

2. Git README.txt explaining:
code architecture

**Coding Challenge Time**
1. We accept both full solutions as well as time bound soluitions.
2. For time bound solutions, we are looking for 2 hours of work in the following format:
a. 30mins design/document/draw the architecture of the game
b. 60mins writing the skeleton of the app as you would for any application. Please focus on building a workable UI flow first.
c. 30mins document the rest of the app design including strategies on handling UI, class architecture, special edge cases considered
